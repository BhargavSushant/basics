/**
 * How node Works
 * > Asyncronous : analogy : like a waiter kitchen chef customer analogy
 * > this is called non blocking
 * > single thread , event loop, callback, promise, event queue
 * > Node apps are async by default,
 * > Must not be used for CPU intensive applications. (Video processing, Data Crunching , ML that sort of stuff)
